# MrFreeze
MrFreeze is an LV2 Plugin designed for the [Mod Duo](https://moddevices.com/) (although it can be also built for other platforms).
This LV2 plugin is an audio effect that provides an infinite sustain pedal for any tonal sound in a way similar as the [Electro Harmonix Freeze pedal](http://www.ehx.com/products/freeze).
A demo of the effect on the Mod Duo can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2q3qYi2cyKQUEZCcmJyWmszMDQ).
